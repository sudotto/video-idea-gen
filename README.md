## Otto Notation: the "worst" naming convention
- Hungarian Notation `char letter` -> `char c_letter`
- Abbreviation `char c_letter` -> `char c_l` or if `char c_l` already exists: `char c_l2`
- Nobody likes "kYlE" `char c_l` `char c_c` (l is a letter in "kyle")
- All keywords and types are renamed `char c_c` -> `alphabetical_character c_c`
